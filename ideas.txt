Ideas for Witch Game

You can shoot balls as fast as you want, but they only regen (energy) at a certain pace.

use multitouch for secondary move

Multitouch, makes a wall in between the two fingers

Main goal: get to end of the game and beat final boss. Each time you die, you must start
over completely, but will retain any items and xp from previous runs.
