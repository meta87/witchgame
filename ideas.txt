Gorilla Game Ideas

Throw banana by choosing a moving arrow for direction and moving guage for power.

Have special powers to dodge banana, like jump to next building

when banana hits building, it smooshes, then explodes. 

camera tracks with banana after toss, consider not showing player other players location so they have to send out "scout bananas"

have levels look like a city skyscraper, different shapes of buildings, people shaking fists out windows   

Power ups when you hit different things with bananas. (One power up could give u a shield etc)

Special banana powerups! Frozen banana, that keeps going into more blocks...
MORE POWERUPS: THROW ITEM THAT MAKES A WALL WHEN YOU PRESS AGAIN. THROW AN ITEM THAT MAKES YOU TELEPORT TO WHEREVER IT LANDS
Also, the ability to jetpack up so that you change the angle of the toss.
Another Powerup: Make the other player's power gauge or angle go really fast or act nonsensical. 


winddddd

The Pointer is a gorilla finger! animate the hand!
The strength is blood boiling with smoke

local multiplayer turn based

certain things explode your banana (the sun, or a passing bird eating it)

HAVE A Transculent indication of the power and angle of the previous shot.
